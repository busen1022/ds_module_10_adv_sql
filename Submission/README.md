# README: ds_module_10_adv_sql
This is a Data Bootcamp Homework Submission for Module 10 Advanced SQL. 

In the homework, we used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to create a python script, called "climate_starter," to develop queries and charts based on given questions. We also used [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) to generate an API, called app, returning information from the the previously generated queries.
